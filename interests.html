                <h2>Anime</h2>
                <p>
                    From absolute peak fiction such as <em>Attack On Titan</em> to deep psychologial shows like <em>Death Note</em>, anime has been my escape from the stresses of life since way back in 6th grade. I love the stunning art styles, insane character development, and lore that gets you thinking. My current and longest hyperfixation has been <em>Blue Lock</em> with its immensely motivational messages.

                    Nothing compares to the smell of fresh pages. I love love love reading. From the magical world of <em>Harry Potter</em> to the sci-fi filled mystery that is <em>Warcross</em>. A series I was OBSESSED with as a child that will never leave my heart called <em>The Unwanteds</em> has such amazing world building. With school and all I haven't had much time to read these past few months but I am getting back on track with <em>Maze Runner</em> as the movie did it justice.

                    When I'm not in a storybook land or binging a show, you'll find me coding my heart out, kicking butt in taekwondo, or painting (still honing my art skills so bare with me). I also have a newfound obsession with graphic design. My Canva looks like a scrapbook got run over by a tornado.
